TODO:

- Render events to month/week views:
	- fix event spanning in fullday/week view
	- multiple dates on any one day - stacking/sorting?
	- wrapping long events from one week to next
	- moveable dates in month view
	- resizeable dates in week view

 -date bug when switching between month/week view; e.g. viewing august 2014 in month view, switch to week, goes to july; back to month, stays on July.


LONG-TERM:

- fully responsive
- google calendar api integration:
	- key fields: start.date / start.dateTime, end.date / end.dateTime, summary, recurrence, reminders / reminders.overrides
- full accessibility: ARIA roles etc
	- skip links
- searchable events
