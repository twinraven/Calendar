TODO:

- Merge row & week? Increasingly shared functionality.
- date popup - add/edit
- Render events to month/week views:
	- moveable dates in week/month view
	- resizeable dates in week view
	- Repeating events! YIKES

ISSUES:

- somehow, event data is being set for all events, across all instances inside of each row (subsequent data manipulation affects prior instances). Shouldn't be possible, but is.
- Need to duplicate packing algorithm for week view; then, refactor out duplication between row and week (somehow). Rename views?



LONG-TERM:

- google calendar api integration:
	- key fields: start.date / start.dateTime, end.date / end.dateTime, summary, recurrence, reminders / reminders.overrides
- full accessibility: ARIA roles etc
	- skip links
- searchable events
