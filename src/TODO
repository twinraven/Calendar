TODO:

- Fix weird week-view bug
- Consider removing time collection/model/view, use static markup. Benefits of keeping in BB?
- Render events to month/week views
- refactor JS file/module naming. Getting unmanageable - split into folders perhaps? sub-modules


TECH DEBT:

- fix auto-updating views every minute (breaks when you're not viewing current week/month)


LONG-TERM:

- google calendar api integration:
	- key fields: start.date / start.dateTime, end.date / end.dateTime, summary, recurrence, reminders / reminders.overrides
- skip links
- full accessibility: ARIA roles etc
