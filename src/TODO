- iconography
- responsive view: make it work on mobile
	- hide summary bar entirely for now

	- font sizes
	- stop auto-filling heights


LONG-TERM:

- fully responsive
- google calendar api integration:
	- key fields: start.date / start.dateTime, end.date / end.dateTime, summary, recurrence, reminders / reminders.overrides
- full accessibility: ARIA roles etc
	- skip links
- searchable events
