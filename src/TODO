TODO:

- Merge row & week? Increasingly shared functionality
- Refactor row/week generally - lots of repeated code.
- date popup - add/edit

- moveable dates in week/month view
- resizeable dates in week view
- Recurring events! YIKES


LONG-TERM:

- google calendar api integration:
	- key fields: start.date / start.dateTime, end.date / end.dateTime, summary, recurrence, reminders / reminders.overrides
- full accessibility: ARIA roles etc
	- skip links
- searchable events
